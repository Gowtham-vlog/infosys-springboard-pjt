## Project Title : AI-Driven B2B Lead Scoring.
This repository contains the code and projects developed during my infosys internship. AI-driven B2B lead scoring uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze various data points—such as firmographics, behavior, engagement history, and intent signals—to rank leads based on their likelihood to convert.
